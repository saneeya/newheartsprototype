	<h1> Crossroads: Addiction Recovery Assistance </h1>
	
		<h3>Every heart deserves to be free from violence.</h3>
	<p>At <em>New Hearts Recovery Network</em> we realize that domestic violence* can happen to anyone despite race, age, or gender. We help children and adults who are abused and provide resources for domestic violence.</p>
	<p>Battered men and women typically overlook, deny, or excuse domestic violence especially when it is psychological over physical. Acknowledging the signs of an abusive relationship is the first step out of denial and ending the abuse.</p>

	<p><em>*The <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_report2010-a.pdf">National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey</a> (NISVS) reports,&nbsp;nearly 20 people per minute are physically abused by an intimate partner in the United States. During one year, this equates to more than 10 million women and men.</em></p>
	<p><em>*According to the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_report2010-a.pdf">NISVS</a>, 1 in every 5 women and 1 in every 7 men have been victims of severe physical violence by an intimate partner in their lifetime.&nbsp;Domestic violence is the leading cause of injury to women between the ages of 15 and 44 in the United States, more than car accidents, muggings, and rapes combined. (“Violence Against Women, A Majority Staff Report,” Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, 102nd Congress, October 1992, p.3.).</em></p>
