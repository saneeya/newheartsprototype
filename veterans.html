		<h3>At <em>New Hearts Recovery Network</em> we believe it’s time to give back to those who have given us so much freedom and hope for the future. &nbsp;We provide assistance, support and resources to U.S Veterans who are in need of immediate help or relief.</h3>
		<p>According to <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2014/11/10/veterans-day-data-boot-camp" target="_blank">US News</a> in 2014, there were approximately 21.8 million veterans of the U.S armed forces. More than 50% of these veterans need help physically, emotionally, mentally and desire treatment or some form of help. U.S Veterans do not have the easiest access to health care; not every veteran is automatically eligible to enroll in VA health care.</p>
		<p>In<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3496463/" target="_blank"> a recent study</a>&nbsp;of about&nbsp;600 veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan, 39% of them suffer from alcohol abuse; 14% post-traumatic stress disorder; 3% drug abuse. Major depression is also a significant problem among veterans in the United States.</p>
		<p><em>U.S Veterans are men and women who have sacrificed their lives and well being for the safety of our country. The number of disabled veterans is constantly on the rise. Disabled veterans not only suffer from physical ailments but also emotional and mental disabilities. PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) is a mental health condition triggered by experiencing or witnessing a terrifying event. PTSD is one of many mental health conditions that is common among U.S veterans. Treatment for PTSD may involve different types of psychotherapy as well as medications to manage depression or anxiety, however, everyone’s recovery process and journey will look different.</em></p>
